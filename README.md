**Student Budget Tracker**

Financial difficulties are a common obstacle faced by college students as they progress through their studies. They have limited resources, so they must manage their tuition, textbooks, accommodation, food, transportation, and social activities. Keeping track of income, expenses, and savings objectives can be difficult for many students, which can cause stress and even debt.

The task at hand is to develop an easy-to-use budgeting application tailored to the needs of college students in order to tackle this problem. The software ought to offer a way for students to take charge of their money, decide what they really need to spend, and strive toward financial stability.
